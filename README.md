# Boilerplate React Project

The intention for this project is to have a codebase that can be forked/cloned and used to easily get up and running with a React project. <br/>
The bulk of the heavy lifting here is handled by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). I have just added some hooks to verify coding standards & commit messages, a suggested folder structure and scripts to deploy to github pages, as outlined by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). <br />
Much of this configuration I learnt from following Jesse Weigel and [his stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUPBEpfBEXo&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbkxYR9ly9ksx8UYyCpBRmMc) on YouTube. Abig shout ]out to [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) as well

## Prerequisites
**Node & npm**<br/>
The server and node pacakge needed to run application
``` 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/  
```

**yarn**<br/>
A dependency manager for the project, that's a bit better than npm.
```
npm i yarn -g
```
More information on yarn can be found [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/)


**Optional**<br />
If you want to use create-react-app by itself, you can install that globally. <br/>
``` 
yarn add create-react-app -g
```


## Next Steps
Moving forward, i will be adding areas for comprehensive unit and functional testing. I also want to add a suggested folder structure for using redux. I am accepting PRs for any of these :)
